This is for anyone interested in developing their own OS with a high resolution.

It boots into 32 bit protected mode and enables VESA with a bare bones boiler plate to design your own GUI using address blocks, and a higher level language like C/C++, or you can stick with Assembly. Whichever you prefer.

It's just the standard setup set and forget stuff, and I am not bugged if you just copy it.

The compilation folder has a couple of readmes with instructions on what to do, but I'll be the first to admit, I could have done a better job explaining ... so I am making a whole new repository with more detailed instructions too, which will be uploaded at some point in the future as a new repository.
