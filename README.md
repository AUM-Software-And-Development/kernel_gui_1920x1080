I wrote these over the course of a summer to provide a starting point for a bootloader + kernel that has the capacity for extension using either a high level language, or a low level language. This was simply a starting point at the time of its writing, and you are free to use the source code as you please.

The primary intention of this project is to boot an OS with VESA capabilities, which it does.
