Thank you for viewing this OS.

It is kept as simple as possible for newcomers and me.

There are instructions on how to build this entire thing 
on Windows and Linux.

These instructions are fairly simple, and should be mostly 
beginner friendly.

These instructions were not included in my first commits, 
since I hadn't thought of that yet.

After this enters a High Level Language phase, I will 
make a new git repo containing new sets of instructions 
for all bit modes (16, 32, 64).
